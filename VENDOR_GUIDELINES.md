# Vendor Guidelines

Vendors can make up an important part of our community, and our [Slack team](https://slack.osquery.io) provides a unique method to engage with a user base directly, but vendors should adhere to the following guidelines to help ensure they do not engage in behaviour that violates our Code of Conduct or Vendor Guidelines.

## Direct Messages & Emails

It is not permitted to direct message a member of our community for the purposes of promoting your product without their clear permission beforehand. Further, it is not permitted to use email addresses acquired from the Slack to reach out to users about a vendor product.

### What is okay

> Vendor: Hey @personX, is it ok if I message you about #productY?

> personX: Sure, that's fine.

### What is not okay

* Direct messaging the user before they have responded to a posting in a public channel like the above.
* Direct messaging the user when they have responded in any manner that could be taken as a negative response to a posting in a public channel like the above.
* Emailing a user about a vendor product after pulling their email from their Slack account.

## Promoting your product in public channels

If you wish to promote your product in a public channel, it is important that:

* Your message is relevant to the current discussion topic. For example, if you make a proprietary osquery server, it may be useful to post a link to your own channel if the current discussion is on a topic that is especially relevant.
* Your message cannot be considered 'spam' - in addition to being on topic, it shouldn't be posted repeatedly, either in the same channel or in multiple channels.

### What is okay

> personX: I'm looking for a tool that performs X - does anyone have any ideas?

> Vendor: Hey @personX, I work for companyY and we make something that may help. Maybe you would like to come over to #companyY?

### What is not okay

> [Unrelated conversation]

> Hey! We're reaching out to organizations to see if you would be interested in streamlining security operations and incident response using an Osquery-based security platform. Would you be interested in seeing a demo or webinar?
